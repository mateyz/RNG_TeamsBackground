# Randomized WoW teams backgrounds
Make it look like you're travelling azeroth during the week with different backgrounds provided by Blizzard which update each day!

You can change the backgrounds from WoW to something else (If you're a loser).

### Setting up
#### First time Background
For first time use, head over to Teams and select a new background, click "Add" and proceed to find your Images file.
 - HOME/Documents/GitHub/RNG_TeamsBackground/Images
Select "Default.jpg"

Changing your background manually in the future will prevent the app from changing your background on startup - simply reselect "Default.jpg" to continue getting random backgrounds.

#### Launching randomized daily pictures
To automate this easily, we'll use the "Automator" tool as well as launching applications through User & Groups on MacOS.

#### Enabling day / night themes
